# Do's & Don't
- Don't use these tools to do stupid things like investigating/hacking without consent on your friends, or worst, your recruiter.
- Read books, manuals, articles, be curious and not just a script kiddie.
- Practice using challenges, not real targets!
- I wish you don't use these tools for illegal purposes, but if you do, I sure hope you know what you're doing.

# Some vocabulary

<b>Infosec</b>: Information security, which is the practice of preventing unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, recording or destruction of information. <br>

<b>Opsec</b>: Operations security, which is a process that identifies critical information to determine if friendly actions can be observed by enemy intelligence, determines if information obtained by adversaries could be interpreted to be useful to them, and then executes selected measures that eliminate or reduce adversary exploitation of friendly critical information. <br>

<b>Black/grey/white hat hacker</b>: Someone who uses bugs or exploits to break into systems or applications. The goal and the method differs depending if they're a black, grey or white hat hacker. A black hat is just someone malicious that does not wait permission to break into a system or application. A white hat is usually a security researcher who practice ethical hacking. A grey hat is just in the middle of these two kind of hackers, they might want to be malicious if it can be benefit (data breach, money, whistleblowing ...). <br>

<b>Penetration tester</b>: An ethical hacker who practices security, tests applications and systems to prevent intrusions or find vulnerabilities.

<b>Security researcher</b>: Someone who practices pen testing and browses the web to find phishing/fake websites, infected servers, bugs or vulnerabilities. They can work for a company as a security consultant and are most likely a Blue teamer.

<b>Reverse engineering</b>: Reverse engineering, also called back engineering, is the process by which a man-made object is deconstructed to reveal its designs, architecture, or to extract knowledge from the object. Similar to scientific research, the only difference being that scientific research is about a natural phenomenon. Wikipedia

<b>Social engineering</b>: In the context of information security, it refers to psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. A type of confidence trick for the purpose of information gathering, fraud, or system access, it differs from a traditional "con" in that it is often one of many steps in a more complex fraud scheme. The term "social engineering" as an act of psychological manipulation of a human, is also associated with the social sciences, but its usage has caught on among computer and information security professionals.
